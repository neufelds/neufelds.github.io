### Midsummer Day Dreams

How are we doing? Busy! 

It has been a great couple of weeks! We have been extremely busy working. I (Alyson) have been working at McDonalds and have had shifts of odd hours but almost full time! The air conditioning hardly works at McDonalds and I work mainly on grill, which is insanely hot and really drains a person! 

I (Tim) have been working maintenance for the church, which has involved everything from landscaping to drywalling to woodworking and beyond. I’ve gotten to use some forgotten skills, as well as develop a great deal more niche skills. I’ve enjoyed my time in this role, but also eagerly anticipate the shift to internship in September. 

We recently got 5, 18 week old laying hens on August 1st. Aly has earned the title of Chicken Chaser. A few have gotten out and she has been able to round them up and bring them back. The chickens have just begun to lay, and we have our first half dozen of eggs!

We have been enjoying the water out here, we have had a few beach days, a day canoe trip with the church, and we went kayaking with people from the church as well! The weather has been lovely and we’ve been enjoying every day off with fun activities!

My (Tim’s) parents came out, which was really great to show them our stomping grounds as well as get acquainted with the church I am working in. We were able to do a lot of things we wanted to, but left enough for them to come back again! :)

After my parents left, we had the opportunity to try out our new car camping setup and go to PEI. Our purpose to head to the island was dual: for exploration and to meet with some ground-level church planters. The meeting was inspiring, and I’m thoroughly excited with the concept of church planting with the coffee industry. It’s in its infant stages, but it has some serious potential.

Our Garden is getting there, but every once and awhile the deer come back and trim it a bit! But it will be what it will be! ☺ We have had bountiful harvests of dill, kale, lettuce, carrots, radishes, and the tomatoes, melons, peppers, and zucchinis are getting there. It’s pretty awesome to literally go outside and get ingredients for supper. I’m glad Aly doesn’t mind the gardening, because I really like the fresh produce.

We’ve really been enjoying getting to know the church! We also visited another Alliance Church in the area. It is a small church that gets together in a community center.  They are small but a very close knit family, they are all insanely nice and super inviting. This month we have met half a dozen missionaries from almost every continent -- it has been great to hear their stories and learn how we can support them here and now. 

God has really been showing us the beauty of this planet! Our one repeated question as we have been exploring is this: “why don’t more people live here?” It is so beautiful, the people are so friendly, the real estate prices are so reasonable, it just doesn’t make sense why the Maritimes are not at max human capacity. On second thought, it’s nice the way it is.

Some Prayer Requests we have are: 
- Transition from work to school for Aly
- Transition from job to Intership for Tim
- Finances 
- Continued stirring of our hearts for the global church
