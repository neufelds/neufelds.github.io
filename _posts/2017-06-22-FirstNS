## Edits & Additions from Tim
 - The population is actually 20,144, Aly forgot to include Bible Hill and Truro Heights as part of the Truro population. We live in Truro Heights technically, but you will never be able to tell when you cross between these, as they are all connected.
 - We got our car window fixed now! 
 - Cape Chignecto is a 52km hike
 - Halifax is really cool, and we have a bunch of things we would like to show you all!
 
## Since the vid... 
 - Aly got a job at good old McDonalds
 - We went to visit our cousins in Yarmouth and had a great time! 
 - Tim Started working for the church, mostly fixing things and painting things during the summer
 - Aly planted a big garden! (the deer keep eating bits of it)

Thanks for watching, we want to stay connected with you people! 
Thank you for your continued prayer & support!
