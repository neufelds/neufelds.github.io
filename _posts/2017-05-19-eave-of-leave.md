## Hey Everyone, 

I figured we ought to put a new post up, seeing as we leave in just a few short days. 

Here are some facts: 
- Our boxes are gone.
- Our car is half packed. (just finished changing the transmission fluid, filters, and brake light)
- We are sleeping on ultralight camping mats (which are remarkable comfortable)
- Our Apartment is clean (thanks Aly)
- We still have too much food left over 
- We are stressed out & excited
- We will be just fine 
- We will miss our Calgary friends and family
- We are extremely excited to make new friends and meet a new church family

I (Tim) have just finished my exam for my second last Ambrose University class, which is a huge relief. Aly has been awesome and took care of 80% of the packing and cleaning. She's great. 

This is by far the biggest move we have undertaken. We are trying to have some fun with it, do some camping an hiking along the way. 

Side note: We will have been from Victoria, BC to Truro, NS in a single year, with the very same car. Our life has been a wild and fun adventure, and I'm so glad I've got a great partner to go with me. 

I don't really know what to say, so I think I'll stop for now.
Below are some things we would love some prayer for. 

### Please pray that:

- Our little car makes it the whole way without issue!
- The weather remains decent while we camp
- Luna and Teddy don't drive us insane and stay healthy on the trip.
- Remain focused on God in this time of transition.
- Aly can find work for the summer.

Thank you for your continued support!

### Timothy & Alyson Neufeld
