### Hi, Hello. 
(I know we are quite sporadic. Sorry.)

Well, I don’t know how to begin this other than by sharing that I’m now a part-time associate pastor at Truro Alliance Church. My focus is technically young families, including kids to young adults. It’s been really great to work with all the people here in Truro, NS. Aly and I have both been blessed thoroughly by the church folk and doubly blessed to be offered a job right here! I’m SO excited to work here. I think it is pretty special that I can continue with the same people I have grown close to throughout my internship. 

My Internship has officially been completed. At this point one class stands between me and a Bachelor of Theology degree. I’m excited to reconnect with some dearly missed professors at Ambrose. Finishing my degree will have some seriously bittersweet feelings. Although my internship has been completed, I’m still being mentored by Jacob Birch and Scott Penner, and both have been phenomenal influences in my life - spiritually, professionally, and personally. 

Aly and I are missing summer terribly much - neither of us are good at coping with the dreary season called winter. We stay cozy warm with a wonderful pellet stove, and a great deal of coffee and tea. We miss our friends and family, but one of the upsides of moving to four different provinces has been that Aly & I have gotten really close and have only fallen more in love. 

### Other random things you might like to know about our recent life:
* We got a pair of 10 foot long saltwater fishing rods for Striped Bass fishing! (Thanks JTF!)
* Aly is on semester 2 of her program!
* We made mini baked alaskas for Aly’s birthday - google it if you don’t know what a baked alaska is!
* The temperature keeps swinging from -10 to +10 and every other week we have green/brown yards. (if either of us was still in elementary school, we would actually get snow days out here)
* We ate Storm Chips in a storm - one more maritimer item checked off! 
* We won 12 bags of ethically sourced locally roasted coffee from Aroma Maya which we have been thoroughly enjoying! 
* Tim has been pretty much entirely social media absent for the last six months. Sorry I’ll try to post a bit more.
* We have a semi-working aquaponics system, which looks cool, but is not producing quite as well as it should be. A problem with our bendy U-syphon. 
* Aly assembled a custom computer! Woo! (it looks better than mine!)
* Our Chickens are still laying a ton of eggs! (only 4-5 a day)
* Luna is getting little white bits in her moustache, Teddy is more annoying than usual.
* We have taken more photos this year than ever before!

### Specific prayers:
* We are thankful for Tim’s Job!
* We are thankful for all the cards and blessings that we have received despite our distance!
* God is great!
* Searching for Perfect Part Time Jobs! 
* Solutions to pay off Tim’s Student Debt!
* For Aly’s academic future and vet school application!
