Tim & Aly currently live in Calgary, AB where Tim is finishing his degree at Ambrose University and Aly is beginning to work toward her degree.

Tim & Aly are affiliated with the Christian & Missionary Alliance of Canada, through with Tim is accredited. This denomination of the Church is especially focused on Christian missions and growing more like Christ progressively.

Tim & Aly like the outdoors, fishing, hiking, camping, & all that. They also enjoy reading a vast variety of books, and watching tv.

Aly is a big fan of all sorts of animals, but mostly Luna and Teddy, her dog and cat. Aly lives the dream of a home zoo, currently by fostering dogs and taking care of her boss’s red ear slider turtle.

Tim dabbles in computer and mobile tech when he has the time to, and enjoys building computers and playing with operating systems and open source software. Tim keeps an eye out for the latest and greatest tech, focusing on Chinese releases, because they get the good stuff before North America does.
